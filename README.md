Spring Boot Testing: Unit, Integration, and Code Coverage

Introduction..

This repository showcases my learning and implementation of various testing methodologies in a Spring Boot application, including unit testing, integration testing, and JaCoCo for code coverage. The primary goal is to ensure the reliability, maintainability, and efficiency of the code.

Key Concepts
Unit Testing

Unit tests ensure that each individual component of the application works as expected.
Repository Testing: Using @DataJpaTest to test repositories in isolation, ensuring that data persistence logic works correctly with the database.
Service Layer Testing: Using Mockito to mock dependencies and test the service layer in isolation.
Integration Testing

Integration tests ensure that different layers of the application work together seamlessly.
Testing both the Controller and Service layers together to verify the end-to-end flow in the application.
Using Springâ€™s testing utilities and tools like WebTestClient to simulate HTTP requests and validate responses.
Tools and Technologies
JUnit: Core framework for writing unit and integration tests.
Mockito: For mocking dependencies and isolating the service layer during unit tests.
Spring Boot Test: Utilized for integration testing to ensure the controller and service layers communicate correctly.
JaCoCo: For code coverage analysis, providing insights into test coverage and identifying dead code.
Docker: For running integration tests against a real database in a containerized environment.
Project Structure
Unit Tests
Repository Layer: Tested using @DataJpaTest.
Service Layer: Tested with Mockito mocks.
Integration Tests
Testing how the service and controller layers work together using Spring Boot's integration testing framework.
Running the Tests
Unit Testing: Run the tests using your IDE or build tool (e.g., mvn test for Maven projects).
Integration Testing: Run the integration tests similarly; make sure Docker is set up if required for testing with real databases.
